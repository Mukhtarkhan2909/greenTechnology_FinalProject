    <p class="lead fw-normal">Hydropower is, by far, the most used form of renewable energy resource in the world. It’s also the oldest method of power generation. Statistically, the world’s electricity produced by hydropower stands at 21%, and the total number of people supplied by energy generated from hydropower plants is a staggering 1,250,000,000. A record 25 countries rely on hydropower for 90% of their electricity. All these statistics point to the fact that hydropower will still rule the world although other renewable forms of energy like solar and wind are fast gathering steam.

    <p class="lead fw-normal"> Hydropower is simply the process of harnessing the kinetic energy from moving water to produce power. Hydropower is classified as a renewable energy due to the fact that the water cycle is continually renewed by the sun. Hydropower was first used in mechanical millings like grinding grain. In the modern world, hydropower plants utilize turbines and generators to produce electricity.

    <h3>WHAT ARE HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS?</h3>
    <img style="padding: 10px; width: 700px" class="rounded float-right" src="https://www.reinhausen.com/ru/PortalData/1/Resources/mr/applications/power_generation/renewable_power/scaled/Wasserkraftwek_Rechte_MR_xl.JPG">
    <p class="lead">Although reservoirs, dams and power plants are terms that tend to be grouped together and used interchangeably, they actually refer to different elements which are easy to identify:
    </p>
    <p class="lead">Dam: is the civil works infrastructure. Dams are structures that rise high above their foundations with long crowns. They contain an enormous amount of concrete.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">Reservoir: is a water storage facility. To understand their real state, two main variables are important: water level and volume stored.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">Power plant: is the construction containing the generators. Hydroelectric plants are defined by two basic magnitudes: their draft and their flow rate.
